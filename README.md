# Computer-Vision
All the projects here are related to computer vision and image processing.These programs are developed on Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 IDE (Communtiy version) and using OpenCV library with C++ as the programming language

##### Object Tracking (HSV method) :
1.  The webcam camerafeed is displayed along with a trackbar window, HSV camerafeed and a window for binary form of the camerafeed.
2.  Keep the object to be tracked (ball in my case) in front of the webcam and adjust the trackbars until you get a clear distinct binary form of the camerafeed of your object.
3.  Now you will se the object being tracked and the co-ordinates of it's center displayed in the main camerafeed. 

##### Object Tracking (Background subtraction method) :
This method can only be used to detect and track a moving object
1.  The webcam camerfeed is displayed along with a window for binary form of the camerafeed.
2.  When the object to be tracked (ball in my case) has a movement in the camerafeed then it is tracked until it ceases to move.
3.  Now you will se the object being tracked in the main camerafeed.
